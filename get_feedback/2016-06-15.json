Perhaps using a single hue, and increase saturation over time. It would be more intuitive, as right now I feel I have to jump between legend and graph to remember what came first.",

It takes some time to get a feel of the syntax coming from ggplot, but those tutorial examples help a lot. Yes, the html was a R markdown output - I just used knitr and pushed the html output to github pages. \n<@U061A3E0G>, <@U061A5N1G>, <@U1GGRN36X> :  i'll let you guys know when i post the code for making the gif animation. It's not entirely in R, but uses a system command to ImageMagick to convert a series of png's to an animated gif",
